Project Goals
-------------

* The only human input to the system should be whole beans or grounds.
* Coffee should automatically refill as soon as the reservoir is empty, ensuring that you always have a streaming fresh cup of java on demand.
* You should be able able to use either whole-bean or ground coffee of your own choosing.
