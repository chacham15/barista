barista
=======

The open barista project.
--------------------------

Project Goals
-------------
1. The only human input to the system should be whole beans or grounds.
2. The reservoir should automatically refill when empty, always ensuring a streaming fresh cup of coffee.
3. Components should be modular allowing for easy cleaning, replacing, and/or enhancement.
