barista
=======

The open barista project.
--------------------------

Project Goals
-------------
1. There should be no human input to the system. This is made possible via our Refils As A Service Service.
2. The reservoir should automatically refill when empty, always ensuring a streaming fresh cup of coffee, or other alcoholic beverage.
3. Components should be modular allowing for easy cleaning, replacing, and/or enhancement. For an additional price, there should be containers allowing self replacement of the coffee or alcohol.
